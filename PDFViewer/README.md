# Light PDF Viewer for Business Central (PDF.js)

I have prepared a lightweight ready to use free extension for viewing PDF documents in Business Central. I've heard requests for Microsoft's built-in PDF Viewer on more than one occasion. But since Microsoft is still working on this problem, I found it helpful to make a simplified version. This extension doesn't need any additional servers.
